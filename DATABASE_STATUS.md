# 🔍 Database Status Check

## ✅ **Good News: No Database Updates Needed!**

The recent changes were **purely UI improvements and bug fixes**. No database schema modifications were required.

---

## 🛠 **Verify Your Database Setup**

To ensure everything is working properly, please verify these components are set up:

### **1. Supabase Database Tables**
Run this query in your Supabase SQL Editor to check if all tables exist:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Expected Tables:**
- `users`
- `poker_rooms` 
- `poker_players`
- `poker_activity`
- `payments`
- `payment_history`
- `user_game_sessions`
- `user_betting_history`
- `user_achievements`

### **2. Test User Creation Trigger**
Try signing up with Google OAuth. This should automatically:
- ✅ Create a user record in the `users` table
- ✅ Give you 1,000 starting chips
- ✅ Create a welcome achievement

### **3. Test Demo Room**
Check if the demo room exists:

```sql
SELECT * FROM poker_rooms WHERE room_code = 'DEMO1';
```

If it doesn't exist, run:
```sql
INSERT INTO poker_rooms (room_code, pot, created_by)
VALUES ('DEMO1', 0, NULL);
```

## 🔧 **If You Haven't Set Up the Database Yet**

If you still need to set up your database, follow these steps **in order**:

1. **Run**: `supabase/setup-step-by-step.sql`
2. **Run**: `supabase/setup-indexes.sql`
3. **Run**: `supabase/setup-rls.sql` 
4. **Run**: `supabase/setup-functions.sql`

## 🧪 **Quick Functionality Test**

After setting up, test these features:

1. **✅ Authentication**: Sign in with Google
2. **✅ Table Creation**: Click "Create New Table" 
3. **✅ Demo Game**: Click "Try Demo Game"
4. **✅ Buy Chips**: Open the buy chips modal
5. **✅ Profile**: Check your profile page

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

**Problem**: "Error creating table"
**Solution**: Check if you've run all 4 SQL setup files

**Problem**: "User not found" 
**Solution**: Verify the user creation trigger is installed (`setup-functions.sql`)

**Problem**: Stripe errors
**Solution**: Verify your `.env.local` has correct Stripe keys

**Problem**: "Room not found"
**Solution**: Make sure DEMO1 room exists (see query above)
